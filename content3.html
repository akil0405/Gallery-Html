            In recent years, the world has witnessed an unparalleled increase in
            the poaching and trade of extinct and protected species, threatening
            the efforts of millions of individuals as they aim to conserve the
            biodiversity that exists on the earth. With the ever-increasing
            threat of poaching, some of the world's most unique species are in
            danger, some being elephants, rhinoceroses, birds, monkey, tigers,
            reptiles and numerous indigenous plant species.

          <p class="section-text">
            The word poaching from an environmental perspective refers to the
            illegal trespassing or hunting of a particular species without the
            permission of landowners or authority from government-protected
            areas in order to gain from the animal or plant and benefit
            economically.

          <h2 class="section-title">Motive of poaching?</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            The primary reason for poaching is for economic benefit, there are
            many other proposed motives, some being for pleasure, sport,
            hunting, cultural purposes, or because they do not agree with
            certain hunting regulations. In some rare cases such as indigenous
            populations in the United States, hunting is not only used to
            preserve culture, heritage and traditions but also in order to
            relieve the suffering from poverty that these populations may
            experience.

          <h2 class="section-title">Effects of Poaching</h2>
          <p class="section-text">
            Due to the increasing threat of poaching, detrimental effects arise
            on both the organisms being poached and the individuals within the
            surrounding region. Firstly, the population of animals drastically
            declines to the point of near extinction for some organisms and for
            others, they have already surpassed that point. The decrease of one
            species not only affects that species’ existence but also affects
            all other species within that food chain, as it creates a domino
            effect.

              <h3>World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</h3>
              The World Wildlife Fund is one of the largest organizations aiming
              to ensure the sustainable development of the earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>TRAFFIC</h3>
              TRAFFIC is a leading organization worldwide that aims to conserve
              the extensive and diverse wildlife found on earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)</h3>
              One of the most extensive efforts to accurately document the
              poaching and illicit trafficking of flora and fauna regionally is
              that taken by the United Nations Development Programme. The
              UNDP-GEF Biodiversity and Ecosystems portfolio is “the largest in
              the UN system, covering over 130 countries and 500 projects with
              USD 1.5 billion in funding and USD 3.5 billion of co-financing”.

            <li>
              <h3>China</h3>
              China is one of the most popular destinations for both animal and
              plant products
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>India</h3>
              ” Similar to China, India also uses these animal and plant
              products to formulate traditional medicines and other substances.

              <h3>World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Efforts</h3>
              The organization “assists governments and communities to protect
              the natural systems critical to saving wildlife and wild places,
              securing valuable flows of ecosystems services and local
              livelihoods based on principles of social and environmental
              sustainability
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Initiatives</h3>
              The WCS has “partnered with the United States military to develop,
              implement and maintain an outreach program that will discourage
              consumers from purchasing wildlife souvenirs by having personnel
              stationed at oversea borders
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Combatting the Illegal Wildlife Trade</h3>
              The complete monitorization of these networks is not ideal (since
              it would be an infringement on the right to free internet access),
              restricted surveillance may be an option that nations should
              consider.This will not only stop the trading process, but also
              locate these criminal groups so that they may be punished as
              necessary.
